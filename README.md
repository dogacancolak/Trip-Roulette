# TripRoulette

Trip Roulette is a cross-platform app that generates randomized day trips in proximity to the user.

## Installation

The product is currently on beta version where we do integration tests and could not be installed on any platform yet. Trip Roulette will be available on iOS and Android marketplaces.

## Usage

* You can easily generate trips tailored to your interests on **Trip Roulette**. Just personalize your trip to fit your interests and hobbies. Furthermore, simply adjust the trip length and average cost for further customization.

* After clicking on **Generate Trip** button, Trip Roulette generates a trip that will take approximately the duration that you've chosen. The algorithm will provide you with the most efficient route between the destinations. You can also start navigation on Google Maps.

## How it works

* Trip Roulette estimates the average time of travel by calculating the estimated time for transportation and combining it with average time spent on the tour stops.
